CSS rule:
  - starts with a selector (what html element(s) it refers to)
  - contains a decleration block.


CSS properties:
  - color ==> text color
  - font-family
  - list-style-type
  - list-style-image
  - text-decoration
  - text-align

HTML Elements:
  - Link ==>  similar to a, but in head element.
    Attribute Link: 'stylesheet', may others



The CSS hierarchy for every web page looks like this:

    The browser’s default stylesheet
    User-defined stylesheets
    External stylesheets (that’s us)
    Page-specific styles (that’s also us)
    Inline styles (that could be us, but it never should be)
